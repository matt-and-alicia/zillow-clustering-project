## <a name="project_description"></a>Project Description:
[[Back to top](#top)]

Zillow is one of the most popular real estate databases online. One of Zillowâ€™s key features is its Zestimates, a popular consumer tool for seeing how much homes are worth.

Zestimates offer users a starting point in home valuation, but these numbers may not be as accurate as one might think for a variety of reasons and there may still be some error.

That is why Zillow's dataset includes the log error information, which is the difference between sales price and estimated price.

## Goals

- Identify the drivers for errors in Zestimates by incorporating clustering methodologies.
- Document the process and analysis throughout the data science pipeline.
- Demonstrate our process and articulate the information that was discovered.
- Deliverables:
    - README.md file containing overall project information, how to reproduce work, and notes from project planning.
    - Jupyter Notebook Report detailing the pipeline process.
    - Python modules that automate the data acquistion, preparation, and exploration process.

[[Back to top](#top)]

### Projet Outline:

For this project we are working with the Zillow dataset using the 2017 properties and predictions data for single unit / single family homes.

This notebook consists of discoveries made and work that was done related to uncovering what the drivers of the error in the zestimate is.

- Acquisiton of data through Codeup SQL Server, using env.py file with username, password, and host
- Prepare and clean data with python - Jupyter Labs / Jupyter Notebook
- Explore data
    - if value are what the dictionary says they are
    - null values
        - are the fixable or should they just be deleted
    - categorical or continuous values
    - Make graphs that show relationships
- Use clustering to create a subsection of the data
- Run statistical analysis
- Model data using regression algorithms
- Test Data
- Conclude results
        
### Hypothesis

- Is log error  significantly different for properties in LA County vs Orange County vs Ventura County?
- Is there a correlation between square footage of a home and log error?
- Is there a relationship between tax value and log error?
- Could there be clusters in square footage and county location that can help predict log error? 

### Target variable

- We are targeting the **log_error** in this project

### Need to haves (Deliverables):

- Final Notebook
    - Presentation from notebook
- README that explains what the project is, how to reproduce you work, and your notes from project planning.
- Python module or modules that automate the data acquisistion and preparation process


- Data Acquisition: 
    - Data is collected from the codeup cloud database with an appropriate SQL query
- Data Prep: 
    - Column data types are appropriate for the data they contain
    - Missing values are investigated and handled
    - Outliers are investigated and handled
- Exploration:
    - interaction between independent variables and the target variable is explored using visualization and statistical testing
    - clustering is used to explore the data. 
    - A conclusion, supported by statistical testing and visualization
    - At least 3 combinations of features for clustering should be tried
- Modeling: 
    - At least 4 different models are created and their performance is compared. One model is the distinct combination of algorithm, hyperparameters, and features.
- Best practices on data splitting are followed

[[Back to top](#top)]

### Explore:
- log_error doesn't correlate very well with anything
    - correlation with prop_sqft is the highest
- log_error is highest in Orange county
- T-test resulted in rejecting the null hypothesis meaning we can assume that there is a difference in log_error between counties
- Results show log_error is significantly different for properties in LA County vs Orange County vs Ventura County
- Kmeans:
    - prop_sqft and tax_value
    - 


### Stats
We ran 1 - ANOVA Test and 4 - One-Sample, Two-Tailed, T-test

Both Statistics tests were run at a 95% confidence interval

- ANOVA results:
    - f = 16.4687
    - p-value = 1.0865 x 10-10
    - We reject the null hypothesis that log_error is the same across all 4 clusters
    - We move forward with the alternative hypothesis that The log_error is different in the clusters

- T-test: 

| Cluster | t-statistic | p-value | Reject Null? |
| ------- | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |
| Cluster1 | -6.9613 | 3.6034 x 10<sup>-12</sup> | Yes |

[[Back to top](#top)]

### Acquisition and Preparation
- Created **wrangle.py** file to handle the Aquisition and the Preparation of the Zillow Dataset

#### **wrangle.py** Functions for Acquisition and Preparation
| Function Name | Purpose |
| ----- | ----- | 
| **get_connection**(db, user=user, host=host, password=password) | This function uses my info from my env file to create a connection url to access the Codeup db. |
| **new_zillow_data**() | This function reads the zillow data from the Codeup db and returns a pandas DataFrame with all columns. |
| **get_zillow_data**(cached=False) | This function reads in zillow data from Codeup database and writes data to a csv file if cached == False or if cached == True reads in zillow df from a csv file, returns df |
| **wrangle_zillow**(cached=False) | This function if cached == False creates a dataframe from the zillow dataset and returns a cleaned and imputed version of the dataframe and if cached == True reads the wrangled_zillow.csv file |
| **handle_missing_values**(df, prop_to_drop_col, prop_to_drop_row) | This function takes in a dataframe, a number between 0 and 1 that represents the proportion, for each column, of rows with non-missing values required to keep the column, a another number between 0 and 1 that represents the proportion, for each row, of columns/variables with non-missing values required to keep the row, and returns the dataframe with the columns and rows dropped as indicated. |
| **create_features**(df) | Creates the folowing features: age, age_bin, taxrate, acres, acres_bin, sqft_bin, structure_dollar_per_sqft, structure_dollar_sqft_bin, land_dollar_per_sqft, lot_dollar_sqft_bin, bath_bed_ratio, and cola |

### Wrangle steps: 
- Takes in data from Codeup SQL server
- Remove rows with nulls in latitude and longitude
- Isolated Single Unit Properties
    - dropped properties where propertylandusetypeid == 246, 247, 248, 269
- Fireplace
    - If "fireplaceflag" is "True" and "fireplacecnt" is "NaN", we will set "fireplacecnt" equal to the median value of "1".
    - If 'fireplacecnt' is "NaN", replace with "0"
    - If "fireplacecnt" is 1 or larger "fireplaceflag" is "NaN", we will set "fireplaceflag" to "True".
    - Convert "True" to 1
- NULLs in poolcnt = No pools
- Removing column s and rows outside specifies threshhold
- Fill unitcnt NULLs with the mode (1) and delete the rest.
- Dropped null from the property value features
- Fill in beds and baths nulls with median because the range of values is small
- Convert to int and replace NULLs with mode for 'heatingorsystemdesc','heatingorsystemtypeid
- Convert latitude and longitude to positonal data points using lambda funtion (i.e. putting a decimal in the correct place)
- Impute kNN, for lotsizesquarefeet and regionidcity using 'latitude', 'longitude', 'fips', 'calculatedfinishedsquarefeet' and 'taxvaluedollarcnt' with 5 neighbors
- changed fips to an int
- Dummy FiPs
- Dropped columns not being used
- Binned log error column into 4 sections
- Rename columns for legibility
- Set index to parcelid
- Drop remaining null values
- Remove outliers of tax_value and lot_sqft
- Ran create features function
- Dropped remaining null values again
- Writes dataframe into a csv named "wrangled_zillow.csv"

### Takeaways explore_univariate:
- Features with a lot of outliers:
    - bathrooms, prop_sqft, lot_sqft, struct_tax_value, tax_value, land_tax_value, tax_amount, and log_error
- Bedrooms appear to be normally distributed
- Latitude and longitude are good indicators of population density by location, it should not be scaled if being used by Geographical libraries

### Takeaways from explore_bivariate:
- Not one feature alone has a strong correlation with log_error
    - log_error has the strongest correlation with prop_sqft than the rest of the features
- log_error is highest in Orange county
- log_error is roughly the same in Los Angeles and Ventura (slightly less in Ventura).
- T-test resulted in rejecting the null hypothesis meaning we can assume that there is a difference in logerror between counties
- Results show logerror is significantly different for properties in LA County vs Orange County vs Ventura County
- slight upward trend in log error as square feet increases
- homes between 1,000-4,000 sq ft have quite a bit of variance in log error
- Grouping features with clustering should be a better route for predicting log_error
- Variance is lessens as the property value increases. 

### Clustering with: 
#### **<span style="color:green">from</span> sklearn.cluster <span style="color:green">import</span>  KMeansKMeans**

#### acres and age

- Created 4 clusters
    - young property low-mid acrage - new residential suburban areas 
    - mid century property low-mid acrage - mid century suburban and urban
    - old property low-mid acrage - old  suburban and urban
    - high acrage - all ages suburban-rural areas 

#### latitude and longitude

- Created 4 clusters:
    - Clusters follow the general county lines with the exception of cluster in the East.
    - County and location is a strong clustering feature 

#### tax_value and prop_sqft

- Created 4 clusters
    - low tax low sqft - low end suburbs - lower middle class
    - mid tax low sqft - mid-high end suburbs / low-mid end city - mid-high upper middle class
    - high tax low sqft - high end suburbs and city property - upper middle class+
    - high sqft - large houses all tax groups

[[Back to top](#top)]

### Stats Test 1: ANOVA Test: One Way
Analysis of variance, or ANOVA, is a statistical method that separates observed variance data into different components to use for additional tests. 

A one-way ANOVA is used for three or more groups of data, to gain information about the relationship between the dependent and independent variables: in this case our clusters vs. the log_error, respectively.

#### Hypothesis:
- The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is there is no difference in logerror between the 4 clusters.
- The alternate hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) is the log_error is different between the 4 clusters.

#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- I established a 95% confidence level
- alpha = 1 - confidence, therefore alpha is 0.05

#### Results:
- f = **10.3375**
- p-value = **8.5052 x 10<sup>-7</sup>**
- We reject the null hypothesis that log_error is the same across all 4 clusters
- We move forward with the alternative hypothesis that The log_error is different in the clusters

#### Summary:
- This indicates that the chosen features are a good start for modeling.


### Stats Test 2: T-Test: One Sample
- A T-test allows me to compare a categorical and a continuous variable by comparing the mean of the continuous variable by subgroups based on the categorical variable
- The t-test returns the t-statistic and the p-value:
    - t-statistic: 
        - Is the ratio of the departure of the estimated value of a parameter from its hypothesized value to its standard error. It is used in hypothesis testing via Student's t-test. 
        - It is used in a t-test to determine if you should support or reject the null hypothesis
        - t-statistic of 0 = H<sub>0</sub>
    -  - the p-value:
        - The probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct
- We wanted to compare the individual clusters to the total population. 
    - Cluster1 to the mean of ALL clusters
    - Cluster2 to the mean of ALL clusters, etc.

#### Hypothesis:
- The null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) is no difference in the means of the clusters' log_errors. 
- The alternate hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) is a significant difference in the means of the clusters' log_errors. 

#### Confidence level and alpha value:
- I established a 95% confidence level
- alpha = 1 - confidence, therefore alpha is 0.05


#### Results:
| Cluster | t-statistic | p-value | Reject Null? |
| ------- | -------: | -------: | :-------: |
| Cluster1 | -2.4378 | 0.0148 | Yes |
| Cluster2 | -4.4752 | 7.7006 x 10<sup>-6</sup> | Yes |
| Cluster3 | 2.7658 | 0.0057 | Yes |
| Cluster4 | 1.2522 | 0.2106 | No |

#### Summary:
- Clusters 0, 1, and 2 reject the null hypothesis and are good candidates for modeling
- Cluster 3 failed to reject the null hypothesis and are not suitable for modeling.
